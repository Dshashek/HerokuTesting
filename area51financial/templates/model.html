              </h2>
              <p>To create a loan pre-approval tool with a high level of accuracy using a machine learning model. The
                tool must be able to be implemented in real time, accessible via the internet, and use minimal data
                inputs.</p><br>

              <h2 class="section-heading mb-4">
                <span class="section-heading-upper">About the data</span>
              </h2>
              <p>While processing the data prior to implementing the machine learning models, we noticed that several
                the attributes that were unclear or seemed to be categorized without specific data on the
                classification. We removed these attributes from the dataset. We also categorized the remaining
                attributes that were in a numerical format including age, loan amount, and loan duration. We also chose
                to remove other attributes that were related to the relationship between the bank and the borrower. We
                felt that using attributes that were inclusive of only the borrower and requested loan could help to
                remove any bias that the model may have regarding current bank customers as the data on them would be
                more robust.</p><br>
              <p>In the end we reduced the number of attributes used in the model from 20 to 9 including:<br>
                - Loan term<br>
                - Loan purpose<br>
                - Loan amount<br>
                - Years at current employer<br>
                - Co-borrower or guarantor<br>
                - Age of applicant<br>
                - Rent or Own home<br>
                - Active telephone service<br>
                - Foreign worker

              <p>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) - 88.1% Accuracy</p>
              <p>The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve
                both classification and regression problems. During the training portion of KNN, the model is looking at
                our input data and comparing the values to the classes that we are trying to place the data in. In this
                case, we are feeding 9 points of loan information to the model and trying to predict if the outcome will
                be classified as a default or no-default based on the loan inputs. Once the model has been trained, we
                test against additional loan data and allow the model to attempt to predict the correct classification
                based on the loan inputs.</p><br>

              <p>Support Vector Machine (SVM) - 93.5% Accuracy</p>
              <p>A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both
                classification and regression problems. For the test cases that the model predicted would not default,
                the loans defaulted 13.5% of the time. </p><br>

              <p>We used a Lasso model to determine which of the impacts had the highest amount of influence on whether
                a loan would or would not default. The loan term and loan amount were the most relevant factors in the
                predicting a default.</p><br>
